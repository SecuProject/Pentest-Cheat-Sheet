## Loops

### While

```bash
i=1
while [ $i -lt 10 ];do
 echo "$i"
 ((i++))
done
```

### FOR

```bash
for i in $list;do
    ...
done
```

### FOR - SEQ

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10);do
    ...
done
```

or

```bash
for i in seq {1..10};do
    ...
done
```

## Read a File Line By Line

```bash
filePath="file.txt"
while IFS= read -r line;do
  echo "$line"
done < "$filePath"
```
